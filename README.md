## My process
Spent almost 3 hours for my second project, which is longer than I think it should. I spent most of the time fixing the background image (which I still think looks wrong) and the positioniong of the ordered item (ie. Annual Plan, Price, Icon and the 'change button'). I used absolute position for elements there, but I believe there should be an easier way for that (maybe grid?). I will look into that after. 

I've created my html based on the kind suggestions from @ChamuMutezva for my last project to use sematic elements, I hope I used them correctly.


### Built with

- HTML and CSS

### What I learned

Practiced more on creating the big structure. I also learned about background image related CSS styling.
